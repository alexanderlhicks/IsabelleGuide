# IsabelleGuide
The goal of this guide is to provide an introduction to formalising mathematical theorems in the Interactive Theorem Prover (ITP) Isabelle. We review the basic features and
mechanisms of Isabelle and provide some discussion from the point of view of mathematicians with no previous experience is interactive theorem proving. This guide is written for
Isabelle 2016.
